# Boat HeadPhones Ecommerce App

This is my second attempt to create a complete Full-Stack Web Application using Next.Js and Sanity in Backend and Stripe as a payement option that has both frontend and Backend attached to it.

### Purpose of this app

This App mainly focuses on buying similar kind of products like Boat HeadPhones on a particular website. It an integrated Backend with it and a payement gateway as well (Sanity).

## The View of Working App

-This is a website with some exciting functionality 
- Since Stripe asks for money I have a semi hosted website which can lead you untill the payement of the product and tells you about the features just before the payement is commenced.

# Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
